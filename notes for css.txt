Specidficity and cascade


:)


remember that the shortcut for comments is control /


:)

inheratence= cascade= something from the body will
ul = more secific :. it will over ride and this is called cascade
BUT it is not limited to ul, if one uses li, it is within the ul (unordered list) :. the specificity is the li


element most generic
li very generic
class less generic- should be used more than generic
id least gereric- most so if a colour is implimented it will win over the others. Id's should ocnly be used once



classes are names which may then be used later they are like masters (eg.fonty)
